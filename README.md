# Covid-19Web
Covid-19 web application dashboard project done as part of the Zero-to-mastery bootcamp practice. I hope to create a single-page application (App dashboard) that displays the most current Covid-19 information globally provided through different Api backend sources. I will include a list of the sources in a seperate folder within this project.

I am building this Web Application as a MERN fullstack application, that will be deployed to Netlify for the front end and Heroku for the backend.

Thanks to Nick at https://dev.to/stlnick/how-to-deploy-a-full-stack-mern-app-with-heroku-netlify-ncb for the guide I followed to create the deployment of the App.
